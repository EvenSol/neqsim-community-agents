# Purpose

The Well Trajectory and Anti-Collision Agent helps engineers frame a concept well before it goes into an
official directional-planning system. It:

- checks whether the chosen template slot is free;
- plans a 3D curve-hold path to the target, from a vertical kick-off or a sidetrack tie-in;
- attaches position uncertainty;
- screens the path against existing wellbores with the ISCWSA separation factor (SF).

It then reports the governing offset, how a sidetrack exits its parent bore, how far a target must move
to clear a limit, and whether the reach is plausible for the rig.

The agent supports early concept and prospect work. It does not approve anti-collision, select survey
programs or replace the directional-planning specialist and the official planning system.

# When to Use

Use this agent when an engineer needs to:

- Draft a concept well path to a target from a template slot or as a sidetrack of an existing bore
- Check whether a planned path clears nearby production, injection or exploration wellbores
- Find the governing offset well and its separation factor
- Decide how far to move a target that sits close to an existing well
- Check whether a slot is free or requires a slot-recovery sidetrack
- Combine geometry with an ERD reach check for long step-outs

# Inputs

Typical inputs include:

- Slot surface coordinates, or the parent wellbore's definitive survey and a tie-in MD
- Target coordinates (E, N, depth), with CRS and vertical datum stated
- Build/turn rate (DLS) and any kick-off depth constraint
- Offset wellbore surveys, ideally definitive surveys with position covariances
- Wellbore headers for the template (slot, status, parent bore)
- Separation-factor rule (k, margins, thresholds), hole radii and geomagnetic field, if known
- Rig reach history or drill-string data for the ERD check

# Outputs

Typical outputs include:

- Slot occupancy verdict (FREE, OCCUPIED or RECOVERABLE)
- Planned survey listing (MD, inclination, azimuth, E, N, depth, DLS, 1σ uncertainty)
- Plan summary (TD, hold angle, max DLS, horizontal displacement, step-out ratio, target miss)
- Separation-factor table per offset with STOP, CAUTION or OK status
- Parent-bore exit depth for sidetracks
- Target pull-back sweep and the first position meeting the required SF
- Sensitivity of SF to tie-in depth and DLS
- ERD reach indication for long step-outs
- Assumptions, limitations, validation checklist and human review statement

# Workflow

1. Confirm the target, CRS and **one common vertical datum** for every well (for example TVDSS). Record
   each rig's RKB elevation.
2. Group the template wellbores by surface location with `group_by_surface` and run `check_slot` on the
   chosen slot. If the slot is occupied, pick a free slot. If it holds only closed bores, plan a
   slot-recovery sidetrack from the parent survey.
3. Load the offset surveys as `Wellpath` objects with their definitive-survey covariances. Note any
   offset that has no covariance.
4. Plan the path with `plan_from_surface` (kick-off) or `plan_sidetrack` (tie-in at a parent station). Add
   new-hole uncertainty with `add_model_covariance`. Check target miss and DLS.
5. Check the reduced error model against a reference survey program with `compare_growth`. Scale the
   terms if the ratio is below 1.
6. Run `scan` against all offsets, including the parent bores. Report the governing non-parent offset,
   STOP/CAUTION counts and the parent exit depth.
7. If any non-parent offset is below the limit, run `pull_back_search` and propose the moved target.
   State the subsurface consequence for the user to review.
8. Run a tie-in/kick-off and DLS sensitivity.
9. For step-out ratios above about 1.5, or departures beyond the rig's history, run
   `neqsim-erd-reach-screening`.
10. Hand off for official anti-collision. Recommend entering the plan and target in the directional
    planning system with the operator's error models and SF rule. Document assumptions, limitations and
    the human review requirement.

# Required Skills

- `neqsim-well-trajectory-anticollision`: 3D path, uncertainty, separation factor, slot and pull-back
- `neqsim-erd-reach-screening`: torque-and-drag reach for long step-outs

# Example Usage

```text
Plan a sidetrack from a closed bore on a four-slot template to a target 3 km away at 2100 m TVDSS, check
it against the template wells and a nearby exploration well with the ISCWSA separation factor, and tell
me how far the target must move if any offset is below SF 1.5. Public synthetic data; state assumptions
and limitations.
```

# Assumptions

- Inputs are public, synthetic or approved for open-source use.
- All wells are given in one CRS and one vertical datum. Grid and magnetic corrections are already
  applied.
- Offset positions come from definitive surveys. Covariances are used where given; otherwise the
  reduced model is used with a warning.
- The default SF rule is the ISCWSA rule (k = 3.5, Sm = 0.3 m, σpa = 0.5 m, STOP < 1.0, CAUTION < 1.5)
  unless the user gives an operator rule.

# Limitations

- The agent does not approve anti-collision or replace the official directional-planning system.
- The error model is a reduced, systematic-only illustration, not a certified tool code.
- No travelling-cylinder plots, survey program selection, casing design or detailed torque and drag.
- One curve-hold per plan. Complex multi-target or geosteered paths are out of scope.
- The agent does not use proprietary operator criteria unless the user supplies them.

# Validation Checklist

- CRS and a single vertical datum are documented for all wells.
- Slot occupancy is checked before the slot is used.
- The tie-in MD is a parent survey station, and the tie-in angles match the parent.
- Target miss and maximum DLS are reported and acceptable.
- Offsets without survey covariance are listed.
- Error-model conservatism is checked against a reference survey program.
- The governing non-parent offset and parent exit depth are reported.
- Any target move is shown with its sweep and flagged for subsurface review.
- Qualified directional-drilling review and an official anti-collision run are required before use.

The trajectory feeds downstream NeqSim well and flow calculations:

- `neqsim.process.equipment.reservoir.WellFlow`: inflow and deliverability for the drilled completion
- `neqsim.process.equipment.pipeline.PipeBeggsAndBrills`: tubing and flowline hydraulics along the path
  length and inclination

NeqSim has no wellbore-positioning class. Trajectory and anti-collision run in the community skill package.
